Title: Version Control for the Targets Package
Description: Version control systems such as Git help researchers
  track changes and history in data science projects,
  and the 'targets' package (2021, <doi:10.21105/joss.02959>)
  minimizes the computational cost of keeping the latest results
  reproducible and up to date. The 'gittargets' package
  combines these two capabilities. The 'targets' data store
  becomes a version control repository and stays synchronized
  with the Git repository of the source code.
  Users can switch commits and branches
  without invalidating the 'targets' pipeline.
